# JS-Exercises

Daily exercise using Js -> ASCII total 8 Kyu.

Extra exercise using Js -> Elevator distance 7 Kyu.

Extrax2 exercise using Js -> Binary Addition 7 Kyu.

## Description (ASCII Total)

You'll be given a string, and have to return the sum of all characters as an int. The function should be able to handle all ASCII characters.

examples:

uniTotal("a") == 97 uniTotal("aaa") == 291

## Description (Elevator distance)

Imagine you start on the 5th floor of a building, then travel down to the 2nd floor, then back up to the 8th floor. You have travelled a total of 3 + 6 = 9 floors of distance.

Given an array representing a series of floors you must reach by elevator, return an integer representing the total distance travelled for visiting each floor in the array in order.

## Description (Binary Addition)

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.
