## Description(3)

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
0, in other cases

--Description (ASCII Total)

You'll be given a string, and have to return the sum of all characters as an int. The function should be able to handle all ASCII characters.

examples:

uniTotal("a") == 97 uniTotal("aaa") == 291

--Description (Elevator distance)

Imagine you start on the 5th floor of a building, then travel down to the 2nd floor, then back up to the 8th floor. You have travelled a total of 3 + 6 = 9 floors of distance.

Given an array representing a series of floors you must reach by elevator, return an integer representing the total distance travelled for visiting each floor in the array in order.

--Description (Binary Addition)

Implement a function that adds two numbers together and returns their sum in binary. The conversion can be done before, or after the addition.

The binary number returned should be a string.
